I first heard the concept of "set-and-setting" from Michael Pollan's book [How to Change Your Mind](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/529343/how-to-change-your-mind-by-michael-pollan/). The idea, originating in the psychedelic community of the 1950s and 60s, is basic and profound — your mindset and your physical surroundings have a significant, and perhaps determinative, impact on your experience of the world. In it's [original context](https://maps.org/news-letters/v23n1/v23n1_p6-9.pdf), the terms were meant to emphasize that "the character of a psychedelic experience is determined first and foremost by the user’s character, expectations and intentions (Set), as well as by the social and physical surrounding in which the drug experience takes place (Setting)." Timothy Leary, who is broadly if somewhat controversially known to have coined the term, even believed that these two factors alone determined 99% of a person's experience.

Honest people can argue in good faith about exactly how decisive set and setting are. It seems obviously true to me, though, that your emotional state and physical context play an important role in your broader experience of the world, and not just with regards to dropping acid. If you've ever wondered whether your [cluttered desk](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/what-a-messy-desk-says-about-you/) might be affecting your ability to think clearly, or whether [deliberately smiling](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-smiling-really-make-you-happier/) more might make you a happier, healthier person, then you might too believe in the power of set and setting. 

It seems apropos, then, to use my inaugural post to introduce myself by documenting my own character and context — who I am, where I am, and what I'm hoping these words will mean.

###### Set

At the time of writing, I'm newly thirty-three years old. I work in design — as I'm sure you've realized — which materially impacts the way I see the world and spend my time. Which is to say that I'm as likely to stare at the letters on a sign as I am to read the words, that I sometimes get as excited about the packaging as I do about the package, and that the boundary between my personal and professional life is quite porous. 

In both practice and predeliction, I'm a generalist and an avid learner. I'm endlessly fascinated by how things work and believe that I can increase my appreciation of a thing by understanding its core concepts and underlying mechanics. I try to focus my energy on understanding high-level concepts and identifying how they connnect, which helps me pick up new skills and tools relatively quickly. I'm also deeply afraid of stagnation — I assume that my pursuit of knowledge and novelty is equal parts an attempt to better understand the world and to stave off the ossification that comes with age.

Personality-wise, I self-identify as an introvert but am professionally more extroverted. I find far greater solace in public acts of performance — client presentations, public speaking, blogging — than I do simply being in large groups. It's an odd inversion, wherein things seemingly that should feel vulnerable are actually quite comfortable, and vice versa.

###### Setting

I live with my girlfriend and two cats in Seattle, where we rent the bottom half of a split level duplex. As best I can tell, it was built in 1910 — two decades after Seattle's Great Fire and around the time that the city began developing, but unfortunately did not implement, a master plan with a citywide rapid transit system. The house was remodeled within the last decade, though, so it has all of the charm — coffered ceilings, hardwood floors, cockeyed lines and angles — but only some of the headaches that come with living in a relatively old craftsman house.

I do not want to belabor this final point — there has already been plenty of pixels filled and ink spilled describing our current moment, with more eloquence and acumen than I will have here. But, I would be remiss to not at least mention the world as it is. 

As I write this sentence, we're living through a global pandemic, the largest in a century, and the waning days of Donald Trump's presidency. Each day brings new reasons for optimism, and for existential dread. I've begun to hear prognostications about when the news will be boring again, once Joe Biden steps into the presidency and herd immunity has been established. And I can see it — I long to bask in the mundanity of it all — but with each new developement it feels harder to internalize, to really believe. It feels like part of the work of living right now is to remain sensible, in the most literal meaning of the word — to be able to feel, be shocked and stay shocked, by genuinely shocking behavior.

And so, I do feel — optimistic, but also exhausted.

###### Setting Off

I'm going to wrap this up
