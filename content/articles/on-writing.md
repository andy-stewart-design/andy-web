If you're like me, you hold in your head an image of yourself that is, in certain specific ways, inconsistent with objective reality. That image is the person that your friends and family know, the "real you," with layers of ambition and intention piled on top of it. It's not wholly false, but it is fictive.

Journalism was my first toe into the waters of mass communication. In addition to making it the central focus of my college studies, I served as the editor-in-chief of my college paper and worked on staff for a local publication. My switch from writing to graphic design was driven in part by necessity, as I watched the news industry around me get decimated. My work since has been largely focused on shaping images rather than words, but in spite of it all I have maintained a love for the craft of writing.

In my head, I'm still a writer. Nevermind that, since moving into design almost a decade ago, I have not written in any meaningful or sustained way. Sure—I've talked with friends over the years about the posts I want to write, made plans and outlines, pictured what the interface of my blog could look like. But I have not, until now, put pen to paper. And by that I mean, pushed pixels around with my words.

So, that's what I'm here to do—to bring the me that people know a little bit closer to the me I see in my head. 

##### Setting Expectations

As I mentioned, I'm a graphic designer by trade, focused mostly on brand identity and digital design. Most—but not all—of these posts will be explicitly about, or at least related to, design, focusing on the following categories:

###### Method

I've been told on multiple occasions by clients that they find design presentations mystical—"it's like watching magic," they say. I generally take these sorts of comments as compliments, although they stand in stark relief to the lived experience of my day-to-day work, which often feels more mundane than mystical. I understand where they're coming from, though—even as a professional designer, I'm not completely numb to the sense of wonder and awe that a well-executed design can inspire. It can be easy to forget that each creative work is an iceberg, that beneath the surface lies a hulking mass of of process, exploration and iteration. In articles about design Method, I'll be discussing the work behind the work, exposing the unseen, overlooked and underappreciated aspects of daily design practice.

###### Tutorial

Most of my education has been fairly traditional, in classrooms learning from teachers, and much of what I learned there was soft skills like critical thinking, analysis and debate—the so called art of learning how to think. When it comes to technical skills, though, I'm forever indebted to online tutorials. The ability to work through a lesson in real time and at my own pace has been, for me, invaluable. I also love that I can learn a new skill from multiple different people, exposing myself to a wider variety of views and approaches than I can get a single classroom or teacher. It's not that I'm opposed to traditional education—in fact, I occasionally teach an intro design class—but that I strongly believe that having more, quality online resources is objectively good, especially ones that are focused more on hard skills than theory. Tutorial articles will be a place for me to geek out on the hands-on aspects of design and development.

###### Technology

As both a consumer and a creator, I spend a lot of time with the internet. From the articles and podcasts that have helped shape the way I think and work to the websites I have designed and built, I'm acutely aware that my life would be significantly different—and in many ways, worse—without it. The web is not just a source of distraction for me, it's a lifeline. Despite that, though—or perhaps because of it—I have a lot of questions. Articles about Technology will be a place for me to explore how we have shaped, and are shaping or should shape the internet, and how the internet has shaped us.

###### Urbanism

I have lived in cities for the majority of my adult life—first in Atlanta, GA, and currently in Seattle, WA. And despite all the prognotications about our burgeoning era of remote work and the coming exodus of urbanites, I don't foresee myself not living in a city anytime soon. I love the variety and culture that comes with living in dense places, but I also recognize that they could be so much better—more inclusive, more affordable, more sustainable. Articles about urbanism will likely be regionally focused—for now, Seattle and the surrounding area—and will explore the decisions that built the cities we live in today, and the discussions that will shape of our tomorrow.

###### Recommendation

During design school, I leveraged my background in journalism to land a modest side gig writing concert reviews for a music blog. This was, in part, a gambit to get free access to shows and opportunities to talk to bands I liked. That said, I also enjoyed having a platform to discuss and promote music that moved me. With Recommendation articles, I'm picking up that old torch once again to discuss—and to some extent, record and remember—the most compelling albums, podcasts, books and other media.

###### Announcements and Random

These last two are simple and straightforward. Announcements are a place for me to post personal news. Random is a catchall category for articles that don't fit neatly into one of the aforementioned categories.

As I hinted at earlier, the initial goal of this experiment is modest and mostly selfish. I want to capture the thoughts, no matter how fleeting, that spark my interest. I want to understand and organize them, drag them into the sunlight, and see if they can withstand the stress of public critique. For the time being, that is what you should expect to see here—a sincere effort to pick through the contents of my consciousness, to find subjects that matter, and to discuss them openly and honestly.
