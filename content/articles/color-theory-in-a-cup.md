For the past few years, I've taught an introductory design class at the [School of Visual Concepts](https://www.svcseattle.com/), a small-but-mighty design and advertising school in Seattle. The course was inititally billed as five-week trek across the landscape of design and, since it was being offered for the first time, I was given free rein in how I decided to put flesh on the bones of that bare description.

As I planned out the lessons, I was asked to make the class accessible both for people interested in but unfamiliar with design and for people with a background in design who wanted to get back to the basics. Fulfilling this objective meant that I had to thread a needle between being too simplistic and reductive for one student, while also not making assumptions and talking over another student's head. Effectively, I was left to make a set of decisions around breadth versus depth — whether I should prioritize and drill into the few most important concepts, or skim the tops of as many topics as possible in class and provide resources for people to go deeper on their own time. Breadth ultimately won the day, and the class became something between a fount and a fire hose of information as I attempted to gracefully crowbar everything I know about design into a handful of lectures.

 The course inevitably evolved over time as I saw what worked and what didn't, but despite tweaking and overhauling some of my individual talking points, the overall structure I established intially proved surprisingly durable. The class featured three main lectures bookended by an introduction and discussion of fundamental concepts, and a wrap up week to reiterate and connect important concepts. As a framework, I used [Frank Chimero's idea](https://shapeofdesignbook.com/chapters/04-form-and-magic/) that all design work consists of a message, tone and format  — focusing one week about message and giving the written word a voice through typography; one about setting tone through color and imagery; and one about format and giving shape to content through grids and layout. 

Of all the topics discussed, by far the one I was most intimidated to cover was color theory. It's a concept as fundamental to design as any. It's also the one that gave me the most grief when I was in school, and the one I was least confident to teach. Albert Einstein once said that “if you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself.” And so I came up with a with a way to talk about color using Kool-Aid and chocolate syrup.

###### Hue, saturation, value. Oh Yeah!

To truly understand color, you have to first understand the concepts of hue, value and saturation, and how they interact to produce the vibrancy and variety of the world around us. 

Hue is likely the most easy of three to understand. Simply put, it's the property that people typically talk about when they talk about color — whether an apple is red or yellow, for example, or why the sky is blue and grass is green. If you go to the grocery store to buy a pack of Kool-Aid, you would most likely distinguish which flavor you want to purchase by paying attention to the different flavors' hues.

Saturation, which you could also think of as "colorfulness," refers to the brilliance or intensity of a color. If I asked you to rate an apple on a scale from one to ten, with one being "a little bit red" and ten being "very red," then you woud be telling me about that apple's saturation. In our Kool-Aid example, we can think about what happens when you slowly pour a packet of cherry-flavored powder into water. The water starts out crystal clear. As we add powder, the liquid turns first pink, then a light red, and then finally becomes fully, intensely cherry red. As more powder is added, the liquid's color becomes increasingly saturated.

Lastly, value refers to the lightness or darkenss of a color. If a color is very bright, for example, and therefore closer to the white end of the spectrum, we say that it has a high value. In the real world, value is what creates depth dimension. If you were to look at a red cylinder, one side of that cylinder would look lighter than the other because of light and shadows, even though the cylinder's color is actually constant all the way around. Going back to our analogy, if you took a bottle of dark chocolate syrup and slowly stirred it into our fully-saturated cherry Kool-Aid, our drink would get increasingly dark until eventually it turned completely black. In other words, it would start at the highest value and progress to the lowest value.

Let's be clear: this explanation is a gross oversimplification of a single aspect of color theory — in that it intentonally omits detail in order to explain broader concepts, and that pouring chocolate syrup into Kool-Aid is objectively disgusting. There's a lot more that could be discussed, like for instance the difference between saturation and chroma. I'm not saying those types of nuance aren't important, per se, but I do not think they're essential. For most people, and really for most designer, if you understand these three properties of color — hue, value and saturation — TKTKTK.



then you can begin to see the world around you in a slightly different way.
